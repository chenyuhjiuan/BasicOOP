"# BasicOOP" 
This is an App for the basic Java inheritance. The child classes, class Cat, Dog, Mouse and Bird, inherit all the members including
fields and methods in the parent class of Animal. First, the code of AnimalApp uns the Animal's methods, eat() and sleep(). And then it calls
class Cat. There is a super() code in the constructor of Cat. This means when we run class Cat, it will call the defult constructor
of class parent which runs the printing of "A new animal has been created!". The same inheriting principle applies on the class Bird.
